# First things first


- Offset + limit

# More stuff

- Many-to-many

- Auto-Join via connecting table? (i.e. graph traverse). Or just for m2m

- GraphQL like syntax into JSON

- Private/public tables/members/functions

- Validation

- ORM for results?

- Auto-limit?

- Support index, check, default, unique

- Store schema in meta table

- Lift query selections / projections when possible (for example through a join)


# Done Already
- Named joins to support recursion and other stuff
- Two-step: Bind + type inference -> generate sql
- Explicit joins
