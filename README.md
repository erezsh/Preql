Preql (pronounced: Prequel) is an interpreted relational query language.

It is designed for use by data engineers, analyists and data scientists.

* Preql compiles to SQL at runtime. It has the performance and abilities of SQL, and much more.

* Programmer-friendly syntax and semantics, with gradual type-checking, inspired by Typescript and Python

* Interface through Python, HTTP or a terminal environment with autocompletion

* Escape hatch to SQL, for all those databse-specific features we didn't think to include

* Support for Postgres, MySQL and Sqlite. (more planned!)

(Preql is currently at the alpha stage, and isn't ready for production use yet)

# Get started

Simply install via pip:

```bash
    pip install -U preql
```

Then just run the interpeter:

```bash
    preql
```

Requires Python 3.8+
