# Roadmap

Preql still has a long way to go, in terms of features and capabilities.

While plans can always change, here is a list of features that we will probably implement in the near future:

- **Language**
    - JSON operations in SQL
    - API for Graph computation over SQL
    - Multiple Dispatch (multimethods)
    - Automatic joins via attribute access
        - Many-to-many
- **Compilation Technology**
    - JIT compilation (PoC is already working!)
    - Compile control flow to SQL
- **Support for more databases**
    - BigQuery
    - Redshift
    - CockroachDB
    - MongoDB?
    - More...
- **Usability and integration**
    - IDE support (vscode, etc.)
    - Automatically generate GraphQL interface
    - Migrations
